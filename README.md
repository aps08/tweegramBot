# tweegramBot
A semi-configured respository, which help you convert your telegram messages to twitter tweets, also retweet the tweets tweeted by specific list of users.

### How to use
* Fork this repository.
* Get your API_ID and API_HASH for telegram from [here](https://my.telegram.org/apps).
* Create a python file in your local, and paste the code given below.
```python
from telethon.sync import TelegramClient

client = TelegramClient("tweegramBot", "<API_ID>", "<API_HASH>").start()
```
* Give your number and enter code you get on telegram, and that will create a `tweegramBot.session` file. Now place this `tweegramBot.session` file at the root directory of this respository you have forked.
* It is recommended to not keep the repository in public, with the `*.session`, which was created in the first step, and `*.json` file which will be created when you add users to your list.
* Get your BEARER_TOKEN, API_KEY, API_SECRET, ACCESS_TOKEN and ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET for twitter from [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard).
* Set the API secrets you generated in the 2nd and 6th step. A total of 9 secret need to be created, which inclued 7 API secret, USERNAME (*twitter username of the bot*) and ENTITY(*telegram username for the account from which you want to transfer the text to twitter*). Learn how to create repository secrets [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets).
* Secrets will look like these once setup.
